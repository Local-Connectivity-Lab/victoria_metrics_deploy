I ran `./deploy.sh` to deploy victoria metrics onto a server and also an example to send the logs of victoria metrics itself. The API I used is the `jsonline` API. You need to add the same password as the password to log into the UI into the deploy script as an environment variable. I put the script I used for deploying the ldap logs as well in this repo for reference. The current url is https://log.infra.seattlecommunitynetwork.org/
